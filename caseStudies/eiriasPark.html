            <h1>Eirias Park Lighting</h1>
        </article>
        <article class="grey">
            <p>We were appointed by the principal contractor <a href="https://mega-electrical.co.uk/">
                Mega Electrical NW Ltd</a> to undertake the civils engineering works for new lighting 
                scheme at Eirias Park. The area in which the lighting was to be 
                upgraded had numerous risks to consider as it is a popular location 
                with both tourists and local residents. Before works commenced an 
                initial site survey was conducted to enable us to develop site 
                specific risk assessments and compile a method statement to detail 
                the way in which the project will be approached.</p>
            <p>The new lighting scheme consisted of below ground ducting for cabling, 
                manhole and chamber cover replacements and installations. We assigned 
                a team of three operatives all competent CSCS, CPCS and SWQR card
                holders and a site supervisor qualified to the Site Supervisor Safety 
                Training Scheme (SSSTS).</p>
            <p>All excavation routes were marked out and scanned to ensure any services 
                were highlighted. The trenches were excavated to a depth of 450mm 
                using our own mini excavator operated by our qualified, competent 
                operatives. The street lighting ducts were then laid along with the 
                warning tape backfilled in a sand bed surround. Minor repairs to the road 
                and footway surfacing were carried out using tarmac reinstatement.</p>
            <p>The area on the photos showing the stone monuments is particularly 
                sensitive and the works had to take place with caution. We were asked 
                to remove the sud from the trenches, set aside to relay when the street 
                lighting ducts had been installed to cause minimal disturbance and damage 
                to the area.</p>
            <p>All works were completed within the given timeframe and budget. As the 
                project progressed, additional works were identified by the client and 
                amendments made to the original scope of works. We liaised with all key 
                stakeholders on this and developed a new schedule of work to include 
                the requested changes. We were able to accommodate these additional 
                works by reallocating resources to the project to ensure we could meet 
                the new scope. Quotations for additional works were issued to the client 
                for approval before construction commenced. An access ramp to the 
                building with safety hand rail was one additional requirement 
                to allow access for wheelchairs.</p>
            <p>Throughout the works we had weekly site meetings with Dyfed Thomas of Conwy 
                County Borough Council along with the Project Manager and Site Supervisor 
                for Mega Electrical NW Ltd. to provide a progress report and ensure full 
                transparency of management information.</p>

                <p>“A Parry Construction Co. Ltd. were recently appointed by Principal 
                    Contractor, Mega Electrical NW Ltd. on a Welsh Government lighting 
                    upgrade scheme at Parc Eirias. The project was procured through the 
                    NMWTRA framework on behalf of Conwy County Borough Council</p>
                <p>A Parry Construction carried out all the groundworks for the lighting 
                    scheme. They maintained good lines of communication with all stakeholders 
                    which enabled them to work seamlessly within the partnership. The site 
                    team were knowledgeable and professional with good working practices, they 
                    kept the site clean and tidy throughout the construction phase.</p>
                <p>All the groundworks for the lighting scheme were completed to a very high 
                    standard, I would have no issues with appointing A Parry Construction on 
                    any future schemes.”</p>
