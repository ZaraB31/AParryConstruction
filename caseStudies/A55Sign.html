            <p>We were appointed by Flintshire County Council on a 
                scheme which consisted of replacing the existing 
                brown Tourism Signs at Junctions 31 and 32 on the 
                A55. The existing signs and posts were replaced with 
                new sign faces on passive lattix posts and new 
                supplementary white tourism signs on passive lattix 
                posts were installed on the eastbound and westbound 
                approaches of junction 31 and 32.</p>
            <p>We were issued with the drawings and site survey from 
                the client to carry out the works. During the initial 
                site assessment, our project manager identified that 
                the proposed signs would not be suitable for the 
                locations. Following a meeting with the Council and 
                several e-mails back with the design team, the sign 
                design issues were rectified and a second site assessment 
                conducted in order to approve the changes.</p>
            <p>A traffic management plan was compiled with our key contact 
                at Amberon who then arranged for the application of a lane 
                closure to enable our operatives to safely carry out the 
                sign installations.</p>
            <p>The work was carried out at night-time when the A55 is most 
                quiet. We assigned a team of two operatives and a site supervisor. 
                We appointed approved subcontractors for safety barrier removal 
                and re-installation to enable our mini-excavator access to the 
                sign locations to excavate for the bases. All operatives were 
                CSCS, CPCS and SWQR card holders and received a full Health & 
                Safety site inductions prior to work starting.</p>
            <p>All site drawings and utility plans were made available. The work 
                area was marked out and scanned for potential services before 
                excavation took place.</p>
            <p>The excavation for the construction of the small foundations for 
                the signs were carried out using our 3-ton Hitachi 38u excavator 
                operated by our trained operatives. Once the hole had been excavated 
                the sleeves were installed and supported using a timber frame. 
                Concrete was poured around the sleeves to secure the sign foundation. 
                This small concreting works were carried out at all four sign locations. 
                The concrete was allowed to cure before the sign was installed.</p>
            <p>On the subsequent site visit any shuttering/foundation supports were 
                removed. Signposts and signs were erected using a Hiab lorry and 
                MEWP operated by qualified, competent personnel.</p>
            <p>The area around the signs was reinstated when the installations were complete.</p>
            <p>The installation of the four signs took place over eight nights as programmed 
                at the pre-start meeting. The contract value was £49,660.00 and all works 
                were delivered on time and to the client’s specification.</p>

            <p>“I recently appointed A Parry Construction Co. Ltd as the Principal Contractor 
                on a sign installation project along the A55 in Holywell (Eastbound and 
                Westbound)</p>
            <p>I found A Parry Construction to be extremely professional and who maintained 
                good communication throughout with both myself and colleagues during the 
                project.</p> 
            <p>Parry have previous experience working within the Trunk Road network and 
                this experience and knowledge helped ensure correct protocols and procedures 
                were followed throughout.</p>
            <p>The work carried out on site was to a very high standard and the way the 
                scheme ran proved to be a great success. Everyone involved are very happy 
                with the end result.</p>
            <p>I would have no hesitations recommending A Parry Construction and would 
                have no issues whatsoever in appointing them as Principle Contractors on 
                any future projects with ourselves”</p>
