            <p>We have been selected to carry out a number of 
                emergency gulley repairs for Wrexham County 
                Borough Council along the A483. These works have 
                often been requested at very short notice and we 
                have never failed in being able to mobilise a 
                team and procure the materials to carry out the 
                repairs to the satisfaction of the client.</p>
            <p>As soon as the job request is received, our project 
                manager attends site to conduct a comprehensive 
                survey. Following this, a list of materials, plant 
                and operatives required to carry out the repair is 
                compiled. If materials are not held in stock at our 
                depot, then we will source them from local approved 
                suppliers at the best price. Our project manager 
                will then confirm that we are able to undertake the 
                works on the specified night to the client.</p>
            <p>The traffic management has usually been arranged by 
                the client for night work when the road is at its 
                most quiet or when cyclical traffic management is 
                already in place for maintenance work. A lane/slip 
                road closure is most common and once set up, our 
                operatives receive a full Heath & Safety site 
                induction conducted by our project manager before 
                entering the work space.</p>
            <p>We would usually assign a team of two operatives to 
                this project, along with a site supervisor – all 
                overseen by our project manager.</p>
            <p>The works usually include drainage works and repairs, 
                manhole and chamber cover replacements which have 
                failed. The surrounding tarmac is broken away and the 
                failed gulley pot removed. The new gulley is installed, 
                the surround area is backfilled and the minor repairs 
                to the road/footway surfacing is carried out using 
                tarmac reinstatement and over banding applied to join 
                the repair to the existing surface</p>
            <p>This work is carried out as part of an ongoing agreement 
                with Wrexham County Borough Council on an ad-hoc basis. 
                Over the course of a year the typical contract value for 
                this work could be up to £40,000.00 depending on the 
                repairs that need completing.</p>

            <p>“WCBC have used A Parry Construction on many occasions for 
                planned and emergency works on the A483 and A5 Trunk Road 
                network over the last 5 years. They have always been professional 
                and efficient with the works they undertake which is typically 
                gully repair or replacement, drainage, patching or kerbing works. 
                They always provide a realistic timeframe for works and comply 
                with the H+S requirements on the Trunk Road network. On the rare 
                occasion works needs to be corrected this is undertaken promptly 
                without any hesitation.”</p>
